## Inspiration
One of our team-members is deeply affected by this issue. Even during the development period, there were grave consequences that were a result of consuming the Papa John's pizza served at HackIllinois.

## What it does
Our game enables players to visualize the daily struggles associated with lactose intolerance. It creates an 8-bit avatar of the player that scurries through an endless swarm of UIUC's most iconic landmarks.

## How we built it
For the avatar building: we utilized OpenCV, Pyxelate, and Pillow libraries. The core game mechanics were developed entirely using PyGame.

## Challenges we ran into
Mapping images onto rectangular objects within PyGame sprites was particularly challenging due to the complexity of the collisions. Additionally, properly combining OpenCV and Pyxelate libraries to pixelate a live image was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As two beginners, developing a full fledged game with a unique feature within a 36 hour period was a very new, but very rewarding experience.

## What we learned
We built upon problem solving, debugging, collaboration, and source-control skills.

## What's next for The Runs: An Endless Diarunner
We will package it as an executable that can run on any system in order to spread information about such a pressing issue to a wider audience.
